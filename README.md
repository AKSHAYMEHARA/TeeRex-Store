"# TeeRex-Store" 
This is a tshirt store. In this project, I have completed below mentioned points.
1. I have used REST Api to fetch data and inject that data into DOM, also considering the filter and search params.
2. I have used local storage of browser to persist the state of cart and quantity.
3. I have used bootstrap for UI.
4. There are some conditional rendering based on user input such as query in search bar and filter parameter.
